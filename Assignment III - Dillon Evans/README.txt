                                        Notes
*   I implemented my heap outside of the MaxPriorityQueue class to maintain organization.
*   The file to be read in is "processInformation".
*   The original text file produced formatting errors when read in, I have contacted Dr. Joshi about this and 
*   he has granted me permission to include my own text file. After I pasted the contents into another text file
*   (without changing anything) the problem stopped hence why I included it.
*   The updated priority must be between 0 and 31. 
*   Run the command window in fullscreen to see formatting.
*   Processes are stored with their priority as the key and themselves as the value.
